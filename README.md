## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - For Deployment
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) \* Used for version control.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) \* Used to store the code once pushed from Git.

### What I learned

This was my second project using React, and my first using Tailwind. There is alot of experimentation going on and I'm not sure the file layout is very understandable. There are a number of JSX components that I built that i ended up not using, and going with other ideas instead. Ive left these files in the project though for future reference. I also struggled to find a way to get the data out of the Accordian component so ended up creating a seperate file for each of the questions in JS and then using MAP to get the data to go where i wanted. It worked but I'm looking forward to finding a better way as I learn more about react. I enjoyed using tailwind but found it a bit frustrating making it responsive for 5 differnt breakpoints sm, md, lg, xl and 2xl. Also the classNames looked really messy with all the css inside.

### Continued development

Take a step back with React and build a few smaller apps to cement the fundamentals.
